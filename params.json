Seperate the paramaters by commas. Example: `'autoplay=1,controls=0'`\r\n\r\nstrip_id()\r\n---\r\n\r\nParamaters: `strip_id($url)`\r\n\r\nThis function will strip the id from the rest of the URL if you need to use the YouTube API for some reason.\r\n\r\n`$url` is the URL to strip.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
